# How to Add and Subtract Binary Numbers

Hello! My name is Christopher Garrett, and today I am going to explain how to add and subtract two binary numbers. I will explain how to properly set up a problem and the rules for which to follow while adding and subtracting. This tutorial will help students and others who are just beginning to learn binary and will help those to understand how we can manipulate and alter binary numbers.
