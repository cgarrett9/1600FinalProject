# How to Add Binary Numbers

Hello! My name is Christopher Garrett, and today I am going to explain how to add two binary numbers. I will explain how to properly set up a problem and the rules for which to follow while adding. This tutorial will help students and others who are just beginning to learn binary and will help those to understand how we can manipulate and alter binary numbers.

Lets start by looking at a problem. Lets add together 10110 and 10101.

$$ 10110 + 10101 $$

To start, lets look at the rules of adding these numbers together. 

First, write the two numbers you are adding together vertical like this

$$ 10110 \over 10101 $$

When adding together two numbers, it is important to follow these rules.

$$ 0 + 0 = 0 $$

$$ 1 + 0 = 1 $$

$$ 1 + 1 = 0 $$ Carry 1

$$ 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 $$ Carry 1
